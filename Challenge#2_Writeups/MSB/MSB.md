# MSB
## Challenge Description
_This image passes LSB statistical analysis, but we can't help but think there must be something to the visual artifacts present in this image..._
## Walkthrough
We use stegsolve to decode our flag.  
Open the given image file in stegsolve and under `analyse` -> `data extract`.  
Since the data is hidden in **MSB(Most Significant Bit)** We start by checking all RGB boxes for 7 since it's the most significant bit

and under preview we see some plain text. So we save it to a `.txt` file and use `grep` command to extract the flag.
## Flag
