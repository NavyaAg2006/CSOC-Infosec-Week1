# OSINT Exercise #003
## Task Briefing
In April 2017 Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo, the then president of Somalia, visited Turkey. A news agency published a photo where he was seen shaking hands with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the country’s president. The article did not disclose where the photo was taken. Your task is to find out the name and coordinates of the location seen below.
## Walkthrough
To figure out what this place is we do a google search about the meet and set the search results time to April 2017 since we know that's when they met. This gives us a bunch of articles about it, one of them mentions that they met at the `Presidential Palace` in Antara, Turkey.  
We open google earth and try to find the doors of the palace shown in the picture and we can get the coordinates.  
- **Coordinates:** `39°55'43"N 32°47'58"E`
