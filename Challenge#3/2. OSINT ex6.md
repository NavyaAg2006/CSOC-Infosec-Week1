# OSINT Exercise #006
## Task briefing:
On January 19, 2023, a journalist with almost 140k followers on Twitter shared an image of a destroyed vehicle amidst a large cloud of smoke and fire. The tweet said: “BREAKING: TTP carried out a suicide attack on a police post in Khyber city of Pakistan that killed three Pakistani police officers.“

The photo is not of the event described by the journalist.  
a) Verify the statement above.
## Walkthrough
On running image search on the photo used using google lens these are the search results we get-
<img width="1039" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-22 at 9 19 04 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07752bbd-e52f-48ce-8bf9-cf5e8fd3a17e" />
Some of the articles using this image date back to 3years ago or even 6years ago which means the photo was clearly not taken in 2023. Even on wikipedia the image was used back in 2007.
<img width="1062" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-22 at 9 23 17 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07603c42-6ae3-4e68-9788-f758836d7617" />
Thus we know the photo is not of the event described.
